# Korpus Dyskursu Literaturoznawczego (KDL)

The Corpus of Literary Discourse (KDL) is a collection of texts covering Polish literary discourse of the 19th and 20th centuries (1822-2022). It collects the works of Polish literary scholars who wrote during the last two hundred years. By design, the KDL is a monitoring corpus, thus reflecting changes in literary discourse through updates with new texts. All published texts are open-access.

## Corpus design
The collected texts come from different sources.
- subcorpus of anthologies (program texts, criticism, and literary theory), 
- subcorpus of literary persons (selections of writings), 
- subcorpus of periodicals, 
- subcorpus of monographs.

### Balancing criteria

- literary era (or sub-period), 
- branch of literary studies (history, criticism, theory), 
- length of text, current of literary studies (e.g., structuralism, deconstruction), 
- place of publication (e.g., Lviv, Krakow, Warsaw), 
- gender of the author, 
- reception (number of reprints, citations, mentions in syllabuses).

Each criterion will be assigned a minimum and maximum value for the percentage of texts from each pool (e.g., a minimum of 20% of critical-literary texts, but no more than 33%), then we will determine the proportions for each period, taking into account the unevenness of production (e.g., a minimum of 5% and a maximum of 65% of titles from a given period should have a female author) - we will use expert consultation in determining the proportions.

### Limitations

- imprecise definition of the population – there is no complete list of publications in the field of literary studies, and the lists that can be compiled from available bibliographic data are not exhaustive
- uneven availability of publications in digital form – in particular, there is little availability of texts published between 1920 and 1990
- copyright – licenses prevent the use of particular texts in corpus work

### Statistics

The corpus contains xxx, most of which are post-1989 texts. The corpus still needs to be balanced.

## Metadata

```
