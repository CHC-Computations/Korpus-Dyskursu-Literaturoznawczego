# Korpus Dyskursu Literaturoznawczego (KDL)

The Corpus of Literary Discourse (KDL) is a collection of texts covering Polish literary discourse of the 19th-20th centuries (1822-2022). It collects the works of Polish literary scholars who wrote during the last two hundred years. By design, the KDL is a monitoring corpus, thus reflecting changes in literary discourse through updates with new texts. All published texts are open access.
